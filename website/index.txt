h2. What

The Einstein library provides a simple arithmetic parser for Ruby apps. Sure,
you could just use eval, but then you're opening yourself up to a world of
hurt when you accept code from untrusted sources (ie. your users). With
Einstein, you get a safe, "locked-down" arithmetic parser and evaluator that
can't run system commands or otherwise hose your server in the event of a
malicious code snippet.

Einstein is a fun little exercise in building a parser, and I'm releasing it
in the hopes that someone will find it useful.

h2. Installing

<pre>sudo gem install einstein</pre>

h2. The basics

If you're only interested in evaluating expressions, you can simply call
Einstein.evaluate:

<pre syntax="ruby">Einstein.evaluate("1 + 2 + 3") # => 6</pre>

You can use variables as well, but you must supply their values:

<pre syntax="ruby">
Einstein.evaluate("x * 4", :x => 5) # => 20
Einstein.evaluate("x + y + z", :x => 3, :y => 4, :z => 5) # => 12
</pre>

h2. How to submit patches

First, if you haven't already, read the "8 steps for fixing other people's
code":http://drnicwilliams.com/2007/06/01/8-steps-for-fixing-other-peoples-code/

The best way to submit a patch is to fork the project on
"GitHub":http://github.com and make your changes. When you've finished, issue
a pull request to let me know about the changes you've made.

h2. Repository access

The repository is <code>git://github.com/omghax/einstein.git</code> for
anonymous access. "GitHub":http://github.com/omghax/einstein/tree/master also
offers a .tgz file download for those of you who don't have git installed
(shame on you).

h2. Contact

Comments are welcome. Send a message to omghax on
"GitHub":http://github.com/omghax. Better yet, create your own fork of
Einstein and take it to crazy new places. If I like your changes, I'll merge
them into the master branch.
