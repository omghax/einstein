= Einstein

== Description

The Einstein library provides a simple arithmetic parser for Ruby apps. Sure,
you could just use eval, but then you're opening yourself up to a world of
hurt when you let users submit their own code. This way, you get a safe,
"locked-down" arithmetic parser and evaluator without having to worry about
someone haxoring your servers.
