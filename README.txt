= Einstein

== Description

The Einstein library provides a simple arithmetic parser for Ruby apps. Sure,
you could just use eval, but then you're opening yourself up to a world of
hurt when you accept code from untrusted sources (ie. your users). With
Einstein, you get a safe, "locked-down" arithmetic parser and evaluator that
can't run system commands or otherwise hose your server in the event of a
malicious code snippet.
