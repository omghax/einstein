== 0.2.0 2008-05-10

* 1 major enhancement:
  * Huge changes to the internal structure of Einstein. Eliminated the node
    classes in favor of modeling the syntax tree as an s-expression. This
    makes the code much simpler, and I have a feeling it will be faster as
    well, but I need to run some benchmarks to be sure.
